df = df %>% select(camis, boro, cuisine.description, inspection.date, action, score, grade, month)
# 8. Unique inspections
inspections = unique.data.frame(df)
3=4
1. Convert all the column names to lower cases and rename the `cuisine description` column to `cuisine`, `inspection date` to `inspection.date`.
2. Convert the `inspection.date` column from character to date format.
3. If we want to perform analysis for each month, then the date column would be pretty annoying because you have different date for each month. Mutate a new column called `month` that extract the month from `inspection.date` and convert it to numeric. For example, 03/24/2016 -> 03
4. We have scores for some of the observations but their grades are missing. Impute the missing values in grade column with the following rules:
+ 0 <= score < 14: A
+ 14 <= score < 28: B
+ score >= 28: C
+ You can ignore the other grades
5. Rename the description from the action column to something short so it won't blow up your graph.
+ "Violations were cited in the following area(s)." => "violations"
+ "Establishment Closed by DOHMH.  Violations were cited in the following area(s) and those requiring immediate action were addressed." => "closed"
+ "Establishment re-closed by DOHMH" => "reclosed"
+ "No violations were recorded at the time of this inspection." => "no violations"
+ "Establishment re-opened by DOHMH" => "reopened"
+ Hint: `gsub()` function might be helpful. The function takes regular expression as the `pattern` parameter, which means `()` is treated as a special character. You might want to set `fixed=TRUE` in the `gsub()` function to leave the pattern as it is.
+ **reclosed** means they failed the second time during the same inspection cycle and **reopened** means they passed.
6. We want to filter out missing values to make our life easier for further analysis.
+ Filter out missing values from the `boro` column.
+ Filter out missing values and negative values from the `score` column.
+ Filter out any `inspection date` that doesn't make any sense.
7. Select the following columns from `raw.df`: `camis`, `boro`, `cuisine`, `inspection.date`, `action`, `score`, `grade`, `month`
8. Return only the unqiue inspections from the previous step and save it as a new data frame called `inspections`. The reason is one inspection might have multiple observations with different violation code but their actions are the same, so we count them as one.
