NYCDSA_ShinyProject

This is the first project in my NYCDSA program. This project demonstrates the use of R, ggplot, and R shiny.

I chose to do this project after visitng a piano bar, which reminded me of how I tend to enjoy music from the 60's and 70's more than modern day music.

I grabbed the data from the following GitHub project:
https://github.com/RosebudAnwuri/TheArtandScienceofData/tree/master/The%20Making%20of%20Great%20Music/data

I did slight cleaning to the data and presented it in an R Shiny project:
https://nsilliman1.shinyapps.io/NYCDSA_ShinyProject/?_ga=2.2858416.1456064316.1624551669-1587964071.1624551669

I would have loved to expand on this project more, as there is so much to do with this data! However I hope this demostrates a good start in the aspects of R, ggplot, and R Shiny.
